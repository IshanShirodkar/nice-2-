## Technologies

Nice leverages a robust stack of cutting-edge technologies to provide users with a seamless and feature-rich experience:

- **Next.js**: Next.js, a powerful React framework, enhances NICE with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and simplified routing. This ensures optimal performance, improved SEO, and enhanced development workflows.

- **trpc**: Utilizing trpc, a TypeScript-based RPC framework, NICE facilitates efficient communication between the client and server, enabling seamless data fetching and server-side logic execution.

- **TypeScript**: Leveraging TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, NICE ensures robust type checking, enhanced code readability, and improved developer productivity throughout the development process.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, empowers NICE with a highly customizable and responsive design system. With Tailwind, developers can rapidly style components and create visually appealing interfaces.

- **Prisma**: Integrating Prisma, a modern database toolkit, NICE simplifies database access and management, providing a reliable and efficient data layer for storing and retrieving application data.

- **Clerk Auth**: Seamlessly integrating Clerk authentication, NICE enables users to authenticate using their google or github accounts, ensuring a secure and streamlined login experience.

- **NeonDB**: A fully managed serverless Postgres that separates compute and storage to offer modern developer features such as autoscaling, branching, bottomless storage, and more.

- **Sentiment Library**: The library currently used to filter out the negative tweets from the positive ones. Will be soon replaced by something more stricter and effecient at a larger scale.
